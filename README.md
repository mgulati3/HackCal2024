## About Us
Airpool is open-source decentralized network that allows individuals and startups to contribute their unused GPU resources. By pooling these resources, we create a shared infrastructure for distributing computational services that are accessible to small companies and developers. 
This empowers them to tackle sophisticated AI models and perform large-scale data analysis without heavy upfront investment in GPU hardware.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Typescript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Other Technologies**: Fetch.ai

## Getting Started

   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the Backend Server:**
   In the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Run the Multi-Agent System:**
   In a new terminal, navigate to `server/Multi_agent` and run:
   ```bash
   python run_simulation.py
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
   In another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Project:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure
